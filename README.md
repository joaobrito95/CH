# CH: Computational homogenization of plastic potentials for porous media

Implementation of numerical-based homogenization of plastic potentials for porous media using spherical designs. Fortran90 code. Software licensed under the MPL2. 

## How do I get set up?
1. Edit the matrix plastic yield criterion and cubature parameters in file `matmodel.dat`
2. Prescribe the loading for the direct and the inverse problems in file `loading.dat`
3. Run the executable file `_CH.exe` (Requires Intel® Math Kernel Library (MKL) for Fortran)
